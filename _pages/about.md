Hello! My name is Anna, I am a physical oceanographer interested in turbulence problems. I am currently in the final stages of my Ph.D. at [Brown University](https://deeps.brown.edu/), where I am adviced by [Prof. Baylor Fox-Kemper](https://fox-kemper.com/). I completed a bachelor degree in Physics at the University of Trento, Italy, and a master degree in Physics of the Earth System at the University of Bologna, Italy, where I was supervised by [Prof. Nadia Pinardi](https://www.cmcc.it/people/pinardi-nadia). In my Ph.D. I worked on submesoscale dynamics spanning from polar regions to biogeochemical applications, and from diagnosis of energetics and transport to parameterization development. In these years, I had the pleasure of working closely with amazing scientists, both at Brown University and beyond, such as [Chris Horvat](https://deeps.brown.edu/people/christopher-horvat) and [Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io/). In my research, I use ocean models and a lot of theoretical and physical intuition. I like to approach new problems (not only in science) with an open mind, and I enjoy brainstorming on ideas.

 I love many things in life, from being in contact with nature — hiking, climbing, swimming — and connecting with people, to doing creative work (including science-inspired projects), and reading and overthinking.

 **I am looking for a postdoc position. If you like my work or want to talk to know more, please get in touch with me!**
